# Dynamic-Pricing-using-ML

So, in a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:

* historical sales data
* customer purchase patterns
* market demand forecasts
* cost data
* customer segmentation data
* real-time market data.

By implementing a dynamic pricing strategy, the company can leverage data science techniques to analyze various factors such as historical trip data, real-time demand, traffic patterns, and events happening in the area.

Using Machine Learning algorithms, the company can analyze data and adjust its prices in real-time. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.
